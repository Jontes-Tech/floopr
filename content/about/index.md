Why would anyone create a free and open library of music loops? Because we can! We are a team of individuals wanting to make musicmaking avaible to everyone. We do this in the hope that you find this resource useful one day, and maybe even spread the word about the "service".

## Why the name "floopr"?
The name is short for Free Looper.
