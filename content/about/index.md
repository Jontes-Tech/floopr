Why would one create a free and open library of loops? Because why the hell not! We are a team of individuals wanting to make musicmaking avaible to everyone. We do this in the hope that you find them useful one day, and maybe even spread the word about our "service".

## Why the name "floopr"?
The name is short for Free Looper.
